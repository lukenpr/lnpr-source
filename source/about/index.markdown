I am an economics and political journalist studying Bachelor of Journalism, majoring in Politics and International Relations and Public Relations, at Griffith University.

I've worn many hats in my career– programmer, graphic designer, researcher, writer, and journalist. As a result, I am uniquely able to blend my interest for the politics and economics with data analysis to craft insightful stories.

I specialise in– news writing, leadership, web development, web design, and productivity.

More about me is coming soon.
